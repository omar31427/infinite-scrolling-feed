this program creates an infinite scrolling feed that shows pictures posted by nasa using their REST API, and users of the website could create an account with a username
and password so they could comment on those pictures, the user would also be able to delete their comment, show pictures starting from a certain date and going back to
the first image found in the API. 
bcrypt is used to protect users passwords.
the program uses a data base using sql-sequilize to save user info.
the user would need to log in again if they leave the main page in any way(back,refresh,logout,etc...).
responsive css.
